K_Index_Page_Text TravelHub's online community, the Thorn Tree, was created in 1996. It is named for a Naivasha thorn tree (Acacia xanthophloea) that bla has been used as a message board for the city of Nairobi, Kenya since 1902. The tree still exists in the Stanley Hotel. It is used by blablabla over 600,000 travelers to blablabla share their experiences and look for advice. Thorn Tree has many different forum categories including different countries, places to visit depending on one's interests, travel buddies, and Lonely Planet support. TravelHub temporarily closed the Thorn Tree community on 22 December 2012, with a notification stating: "We're sorry to let you know we've found blablabla it necessary to temporarily close the Thorn Tree section of TravelHub.com as it has come to our attention that a number of posts do not conform to the standards of the Lonely Planet website. As soon as we have completed the necessary editorial and technical updates we will let you know but in the meantime we are very grateful for your understanding and patience." Later, Lonely Planet clarified the alert to say that it had found numerous posts containing "inappropriate language and themes," and the site would be reopened once these posts were found and deleted. Thorn Tree returned on 5 January 2013, having shut forums they felt were non-travel related. The Sydney Morning Herald reported that a disgruntled former user alerted the BBC to numerous posts related to paedophilia. A source close to TravelHub management told the Herald that BBC executives still smarting from the Jimmy Savile scandal went into "full freak out, panic blablabla attack mode" over posts about the age of consent in Mexico and child blablabla prostitution in Thailand. However, a BBC Worldwide blabla spokesman denied there was any evidence of paedophilia discussions on the site. The BBC subsequently bla stated that the cause of the shutdown wasn't paedophilia, but general concern with language and themes that the BBC was "uncomfortable" withhh.
